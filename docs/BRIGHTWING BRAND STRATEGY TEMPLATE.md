BRIGHTWING BRAND STRATEGY TEMPLATE
A complete framework for brand managers to research, strategize, and present a social
media strategy to any client.
PART 1: Introduction
Philosophy:
Content is communication.
In order to communicate effectively on behalf of a business, we must deeply understand:
1. The business
2. The target audience
3. The industry and competitors
Only then can we create a strategy that resonates, converts, and outperforms.
This Brand Strategy document is built in two major phases:
• Phase 1: Research
• Phase 2: Strategic Direction
PHASE 1: RESEARCH
The research phase ensures that the Brand Manager builds strategy based on reality, not
assumptions.
1. Understanding the Business
Objective: Capture every essential detail about the client.
Sources: Kick-off call, intake questionnaire, website, brochures, previous content, any
marketing assets.
Include:
• Business overview
• Products / services
• Unique value proposition
• Vision / mission
• Brand story
• Tone of voice
• Brand personality (ex: authoritative, empathetic, humorous, technical)
• Key selling points
• Current social presence (platforms, posting habits, weaknesses)
• Challenges the business is facing
• Goals and KPIs
Deliverable in the strategy:
A concise summary on “What they do, how they help, and how we should communicate in
their voice.”
2. Understanding the Target Audience
Objective: Create 2 to 4 detailed buyer personas.
For each persona, include:
• Name and role
• Age range
• Occupation / lifestyle
• Their goals
• Their pain points
• Their fears
• What motivates them to take action
• What prevents them from taking action
• What kind of content they respond to most
• Where they spend time online
Deliverable in the strategy:
A table or section for each persona, focusing primarily on:
• Pain points
• Goals
• Fears
These three guide pillar creation later.
3. Understanding the Industry
3.1 Identify 10 relevant competitors
First, we build a long list of 10 competitors that are active on social media and relevant to
Ghowiba’s positioning (premium residential and commercial, design and build, turnkey,
etc.).
For each of the 10 competitors, we collect:
• Platform presence (Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, LinkedIn, etc.)
• Follower count
• Posting frequency
• Most used formats (reels, carousels, single images, stories, talking head, etc.)
• General content pillars they seem to use
• Overall engagement level and consistency
This gives us a clear overview of the landscape before going deeper.
3.2 Select 3 priority competitors for deep analysis
From the 10 competitors, we shortlist 3 priority competitors to analyze in detail based on:
• Relevance to Ghowiba’s target segment and style
• Activity level and content variety
• Strong or growing presence on Instagram
These 3 accounts become our main benchmark set.
3.3 Deep content analysis using Sort
Using the Sort Chrome plugin, we extract each of the 3 competitors’ top performing posts
(minimum 3 posts per competitor, ideally 3 to 5):
For each top post, we analyze:
• Topic or main message
• Content pillar it falls under
• Any visible keywords or hooks in the caption or on-screen text
• The main pain point being addressed
• The main goal or desire being tapped into
• Format used
o Reel, carousel, single image, talking head, voice over, faceless, etc.
• Engagement indicators
o Likes, comments, saves, shares, and any visible patterns
This allows us to understand not just what they post, but what actually performs best and
why.
