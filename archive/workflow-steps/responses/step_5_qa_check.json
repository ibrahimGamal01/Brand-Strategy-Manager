    "generalFeedback": "The content plan is well-aligned with the brand DNA and effectively balances faith, community, and entrepreneurship. Each brief is thoughtful and engaging, with a strong focus on providing value and fostering community interaction. The visual direction and emotional arc are consistent and resonate well with the target audience. However, there are a few areas where adding more personal anecdotes, specific examples, and interactive elements could further enhance the content and engagement potential.",
    "topPerformerPrediction": "The 'Success Story: From Struggle to Triumph' video on Day 4 is likely to perform the best. It combines a personal and relatable story with a strong emotional appeal, which can inspire and motivate the audience. The use of a real-life example and the emphasis on overcoming challenges align well with the brand's mission of empowering and inspiring Muslim entrepreneurs.",
    "riskyContent": "None of the briefs are particularly risky, but the '5 Tips for Managing Work and Ramadan' carousel on Day 2 might benefit from more specific and actionable tips. The content is valuable, but it could be more engaging if it includes more detailed and practical examples that directly address the challenges faced by Muslim entrepreneurs during Ramadan."
