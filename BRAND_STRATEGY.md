# BRIGHTWING BRAND STRATEGY TEMPLATE

A complete framework for brand managers to research, strategize, and present a social media strategy to any client.

## PART 1: Introduction

**Philosophy:**
Content is communication.
In order to communicate effectively on behalf of a business, we must deeply understand:
1. The business
2. The target audience
3. The industry and competitors

Only then can we create a strategy that resonates, converts, and outperforms.

This Brand Strategy document is built in two major phases:
• **Phase 1: Research**
• **Phase 2: Strategic Direction**

---

## PHASE 1: RESEARCH

The research phase ensures that the Brand Manager builds strategy based on reality, not assumptions.

### 1. Understanding the Business

**Objective:** Capture every essential detail about the client.
**Sources:** Kick-off call, intake questionnaire, website, brochures, previous content, any marketing assets.

**Include:**
• Business overview
• Products / services
• Unique value proposition
• Vision / mission
• Brand story
• Tone of voice
• Brand personality (ex: authoritative, empathetic, humorous, technical)
• Key selling points
• Current social presence (platforms, posting habits, weaknesses)
• Challenges the business is facing
• Goals and KPIs

**Deliverable in the strategy:**
A concise summary on “What they do, how they help, and how we should communicate in their voice.”

### 2. Understanding the Target Audience

**Objective:** Create 2 to 4 detailed buyer personas.

**For each persona, include:**
• Name and role
• Age range
• Occupation / lifestyle
• Their goals
• Their pain points
• Their fears
• What motivates them to take action
• What prevents them from taking action
• What kind of content they respond to most
• Where they spend time online

**Deliverable in the strategy:**
A table or section for each persona, focusing primarily on:
• Pain points
• Goals
• Fears

*These three guide pillar creation later.*

### 3. Understanding the Industry

#### 3.1 Identify 10 relevant competitors
First, we build a long list of 10 competitors that are active on social media and relevant to the client's positioning (premium residential and commercial, design and build, turnkey, etc.).

**For each of the 10 competitors, we collect:**
• Platform presence (Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, LinkedIn, etc.)
• Follower count
• Posting frequency
• Most used formats (reels, carousels, single images, stories, talking head, etc.)
• General content pillars they seem to use
• Overall engagement level and consistency

This gives us a clear overview of the landscape before going deeper.

#### 3.2 Select 3 priority competitors for deep analysis
From the 10 competitors, we shortlist 3 priority competitors to analyze in detail based on:
• Relevance to the client's target segment and style
• Activity level and content variety
• Strong or growing presence on Instagram

These 3 accounts become our main benchmark set.

#### 3.3 Deep content analysis using Sort
Using the Sort Chrome plugin, we extract each of the 3 competitors’ top performing posts (minimum 3 posts per competitor, ideally 3 to 5):

**For each top post, we analyze:**
• Topic or main message
• Content pillar it falls under
• Any visible keywords or hooks in the caption or on-screen text
• The main pain point being addressed
• The main goal or desire being tapped into
• **Format used:** Reel, carousel, single image, talking head, voice over, faceless, etc.
• **Engagement indicators:** Likes, comments, saves, shares, and any visible patterns

This allows us to understand not just what they post, but what actually performs best and why.

## PHASE 2: STRATEGIC DIRECTION

This is where we present the plan for how the business should communicate.

### 4. Content Pillars

**Objective:** Organize communication into clear, strategic categories.

**For each pillar, include:**
• The pillar name
• The pillar purpose (what it communicates)
• Why this pillar was chosen (based on business goals + audience pain points)
• 1 to 3 example topics / hooks
• 1 competitor post related to the pillar (screenshot or link)
• Notes on how this pillar will emotionally connect to a persona
• How this pillar addresses buyer pain points or goals

**Example pillar layout:**
| Field | Content |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Pillar** | Education / Authority |
| **Purpose** | Build trust by showcasing expertise. |
| **Why** | Audience pain points revolve around lack of clarity and misinformation. |
| **Example topics** | • “3 mistakes you’re making without realizing it”<br>• “Why most people fail at X and how to avoid it” |
| **Competitor reference** | (Insert link or screenshot) |

### 5. Format Recommendations

This section breaks down the exact formats we will use and why.

**For each format include:**
• Format name
• Description
• Purpose
• Why we recommend it
• Pros
• Cons
• Expected performance
• Requirements from client (if any)

**Example formats:**

**Talking Head Reels**
*   **Purpose:** Build authority and trust using direct communication.
*   **Why recommended:** Competitors perform extremely well using this format.
*   **Pros:** High trust, high engagement.
*   **Cons:** Requires client filming time.

**Voice-over Reels**
*   **Purpose:** Create high volume content without client effort.
*   **Pros:** Fully handled by our team.
*   **Cons:** Slightly less personal.

**Carousels (Animated / Static)**
*   **Purpose:** Deep educational content.

**Trending Reels**
*   **Purpose:** Quick discovery and reach.

**Faceless Reels**
*   **Purpose:** Low effort client-side, high scalability.

### 6. Buyer Journey Mapping

A table that visualizes how the content speaks to every stage of the consumer journey.

**Stages:**
1. Awareness
2. Problem Aware
3. Solution Aware
4. Consideration
5. Decision

**For each stage include:**
• 3 typical questions the audience asks in this stage
• What we need to do in this stage
• Which pillars target this stage
• What type of content performs best here

**Example:**

| Buyer Stage | Awareness | Consideration |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **3 Questions They Ask** | • “What is this?”<br>• “Why should I care?”<br>• “Is this relevant to me?” | • “Should I choose them?”<br>• “Can I trust them?”<br>• “Are they better than others?” |
| **What We Should Do** | Grab attention, show problem awareness, share relatable content | Build authority, share proof, highlight features |
| **Relevant Pillars** | Awareness Pillar, Problem Education | Authority, Social Proof |
| **Recommended Formats** | Trends, short reels, storytelling | Talking heads, testimonials, carousels |

### 7. Platform Strategy

Identify primary and secondary platforms.

**Include:**
• Main platform(s) we focus on (example: Instagram + TikTok)
• Why we are choosing these platforms (audience behavior, competitor success, format compatibility)
• Secondary channels (example: Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube Shorts)
• What we will repost and how often
• Platform KPIs

**Example layout:**

**Primary Platform: Instagram**
*   **Reason:** Best alignment with target persona and formats.
*   **Focus:** Reels, carousels, authority content.

**Secondary Platform: TikTok**
*   **Reason:** Reach and discovery.
*   **Focus:** Reels repurposed content.

**Secondary Platform: Facebook**
*   **Reason:** Owner has strong existing community.
